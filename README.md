First one-my first machine learning project- is a simple project that aims to classify labels without using any machine learning libraries(manually implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes function). It uses only numeric attributes and has an accuracy which is %36. Dataset : teleCust1000t.csv \
\
Second project is more of an inspection through the dataset. First, some comments are made about the data and after preprocessing the data(label encoding,getting rid of null values and feature importance analysis) I've classified and clustered the data with 3 different clustering(KMeans, DBSCAN and Spectral) and 3 classifying(Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes) algorithms. Accuracies and performance scores(precision,recall etc.) are calculated by using confusion matrices and methods of libraries. Sklearn, pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib libraries are used in this project. Dataset is : Autism-Adolescent-Data.arff
